<h2>Paul Wilson Tan</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm a college student at Adamson University. I have four siblings, and I am the youngest. I love playing games, watching reality shows, and eating out. I'm currently 19 years old which I still can't grasp because I think mentally, I am still in my early teenage years. I chose BSIT as my course since I love tinkering with computer software and knowing how they work as a unit. I also love coding, which was the final straw of my decision. That's why I chose the right path for me, but since I'm still young and learning, I still believe that it might change at any moment.</p>
<br>
<p>if you're reading this, please help me on journey through college. thanks a lot. </p>
